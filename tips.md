# TIPS

* When doing LFS make sure to always back up your VM each time you make some significant progress.

* Make sure you're typing the right name in your myrank rankings.

* Don't forget to bash myscript.sh <week> everytime you change something in TXT.

* Go to class early before the scheduled time (you might even get some bonus points for doing so).
